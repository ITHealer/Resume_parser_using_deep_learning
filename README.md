# Resume_parser_using_deep_learning
Resume parser with ner using state of art in deep learning with transformers specifically roberta.

The link for trained model is [link to model](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/22yw4b7jfk0edmp/AADsvQ9Gm9p0X0dsLgCQD8Z4a?dl=0)
.I did not added it on github because size was exceeding github size parameter.




## Deployment
* Create virtual envinronment with python version==3.7.13
* Then download the generated_model folder(Link is given above) in Deployment folder
* Then in command line use pip3 install pip install -r requirements.txt
* Then run python3 main.py
* And on this  url [link](http://127.0.0.1:5000) you can upload your resume and then the model will give parsed output after sometime so that you will be able to see important keyword in the resume.
